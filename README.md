## Motivation

rasa NLU is a tool for intent classification and entity extraction. 
You can think of rasa NLU as a set of high level APIs for building your own language parser using existing NLP and ML libraries.
The intended audience is mainly people developing bots. 
It can be used as a drop-in replacement for [wit](https://wit.ai) or [LUIS](https://luis.ai), but works as a local service rather than a web API. 

The setup process is designed to be as simple as possible. If you're currently using wit or LUIS, you just:
1. download your app data from wit or LUIS and feed it into rasa NLU
2. run rasa NLU on your machine and switch the URL of your wit/LUIS api calls to `localhost:5000/parse`.

Reasons you might use this over one of the aforementioned services: 
- you don't have to hand over your data to FB/MSFT/GOOG
- you don't have to make a `https` call every time.
- you can tune models to work well on your particular use case.

These points are laid out in more detail in a [blog post](https://medium.com/lastmile-conversations/do-it-yourself-nlp-for-bot-developers-2e2da2817f3d).

rasa NLU is written in Python, but it you can use it from any language through a HTTP API. 
If your project *is* written in Python you can simply import the relevant classes.

rasa is a set of tools for building more advanced bots, developed by [LASTMILE](https://golastmile.com). This is the natural language understanding module, and the first component to be open sourced.
